#Robotics Side Projects
This is a collection of arduino and microcontroller based side projects I make for fun.

*Simple Go-KART
	*This project is a simple go-kart powered by 24v batteries and two Brushless DC Hub motors
	*This code is run on an Arduino Mega
	*The control system is a simple bluetooth control-stick & button application that interfaces directly with the arduino's HM-10 bluetooth module
